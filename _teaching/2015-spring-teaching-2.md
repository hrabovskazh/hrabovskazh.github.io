I developed problem sets and led seminars. The course taught students how
common household decisions (e.g. retirement savings, mortgage choice) connect to the foundational economic concepts.

**Course Director:** Prof. Paolo Sodini

The course is divided in four parts:

### Household balance sheets

Optimal wealth management starts from the full picture of client's finances. To gain insight of the heterogeneity in the finances of households, the course examines how their balance sheets vary over the lifecycle, by education and with wealth.

### Household financial behavior

How do household take investment and borrowing decisions? A growing body of evidence provides a clearer and clearer picture of how households make financial choices. In particular, how much of resources households decide to consume, and how much to save; and, more specifically, how they choose their portfolios: the extent to which they decide to diversify, how they choose to tilt their portfolio for hedging purposes, and how they rebalance over time.

### Portfolio allocation

Why, how much and how should household save? Portfolio allocation should be tailored to the means and needs of each household. In particular, the course  covers which risk premia and anomalies should households harvest and how the exposure to risk factors should vary across households. 

### Liability management

Introduction to the models of optimal mortgage choice to identify how much households should borrow to purchase a home, and which types of mortgages they should use.
